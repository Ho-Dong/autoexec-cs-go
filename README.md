# Rackman CS:GO autoexec and config

Hello guys, this is actually my cs:go config.
Excuse in advance for my bad english but i'll tried to do my best.
In this 'guide' i'll show you how to correctly customize and params your cs:go.

The first step is to create a file named `autoexec.cfg` in your cs:go cfg folder
This folder is located in : `DRIVE:\...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`

I recommend to use notepad++ for a clean editing of this file.

### Launch options

Launch options allow you to do usefull things to your game.
Among others, it allow you to load your autoexec file and set your game resolution and refresh rate.
Enter launch options at `Steam > Library > Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (right-click) > Properties > Set Launch Options`

Non-exclusive list of commands :
